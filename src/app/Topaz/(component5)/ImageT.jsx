        <p className={style.parat}>
          A well-established watering hole in the city, the Topaz bar with its
          dark and smoky surroundings has been a much loved post-work retreat
          for the vast plethora of professionals who work in the city, eager to
          blow off steam and catch up with friends and colleagues.
        </p>

        <p className={style.parat}>
          The bar is well stocked with a choice of beverage options and is a
          great start to an evening thanks to its central location on Galle road
          placing it in the centre of Colomboâ€™s bar scene.
