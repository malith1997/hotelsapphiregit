          Our Family Restaurant at Hotel Sapphire has been a part of Colomboâ€™s

          events, conventions and parties hosted here where guests savored the
          diverse delectable eastern and western menus offered. Perfect for the
          busy community working in Colombo to drop in for a quick bite or a
          welcome respite from all the shopping on Galle road.
